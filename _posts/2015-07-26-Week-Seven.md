title: Week Seven

---

Week Seven wraps up the final week of software engineering before our second and last exam. The class has taught me valuable tools and lessons, and has left an ever-lasting impression on me as I look upon the future. As it is the final week of the class, I wish to not only reflect on this last week but also the entire course experience. 

Upon entering the course, I had no measurable experience with python and web development was still a hazy subject for me. However with the abundance of python lessons within the class lectures, I felt that I had obtained a good taste of the python programming language. As for the projects, I was able to expand upon my knowledge of unit testing, continuous integration, and paired programming in the first two projects. However it was the final project that spanned 3 iterations that truly enabled me to take away valuable programming skills and lessons from the course.  

Hitting the ground running on the web application was initially very tough, my partners and I had very little experience in web development and the tools required for the project. However by the time the second phase of the major project came around not only we were more familiar with the tools, but we were also a more cohesive group.  The presentation this final week went smoothly and the finished product was rewarding. Yet there was plenty that could be improved on.  As the time span allotted for the project was short due to the nature of a summer course organizing everyone’s schedule within that timespan was tough.  There was always pressure to accomplish as much as possible in the shortest amount of time.  However I had an enjoyable experience working and learning with my group members, this class certainly teaches you not only about software but it teaches you about people.

As a final "tech tip of the week" I encourage everyone to look into prezi, making a presentation through prezi is great. The animations enable an interactive experience through what would be a regular presentation.

As I continue with my studies of the second exam (the final exam of my undergraduate career) I feel nostalgia for the previous weeks of software engineering and encourage fellow CS students to take the class, you’ll learn a lot.  Cheers!
