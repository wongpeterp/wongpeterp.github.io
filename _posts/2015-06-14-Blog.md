I decided to take Dr. Downing’s software engineering course as my final class of my college career. I had heard a course with Professor Downing was a valuable learning experience, and week one was certainly a confirmation.  The two biggest take a ways that I received from the course within this first week was the focus on class participation and the attention to detail.  

From the very first day of class Dr. Downing “invited” (if you didn’t answer you were marked absent) students to participate in the class discussion of the material. Whereas many other professors in the department prefer the lecture style format for classes, an attribute of the class that I found engaging is that Dr. Downing facilities the learning process by guiding a class Discussion between him and the students. I admit I am not one to enjoy being put on the spot in class, yet I found the practice better for my own good because it forced me to pay better attention in lecture. You just never know when you’ll called on…

Furthermore, a part of the class that I took the first few days to get used to was the course’s attention to detail. From the quizzes that keep you on your feet to ensuring that you are keeping on track with the specific requirements on the project page, I allocated much of my study time to knowing details. I know I will become a better developer by ensuring I have the bases covered in terms of the customer’s requests, but the thought of “breaking the script” is a little nerve wrecking. Hence, as I work on the first project incrementally and to completion, I am striving to ensure I have all of the specifications that are wanted. 

A tip of the week in regards to a tool that I found useful in the class this week was certainly the use of Git Hub. At my work we share projects via SVN, and in previous class projects my teammates and I took on the cumbersome task of just emailing code. Git hub is certainly a tool that every CS students should sign up for as it makes sharing and communicating via its wiki issue page a lot easier for development. 

As a final remark to students interested in taking this course in the future, my suggestion is to go to the professor’s office hours. I took the initiative to see Dr. Downing twice this week and I feel that I am more connected with the class by asking about course materials and just talking with him about my future plans. A trip is a pleasant experience, but let me recommend you take the elevator as his office is on the 6th floor. By choice I take the stairs, but I promise you you’ll be winded when you reach the top!
