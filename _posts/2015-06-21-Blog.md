title: Week Two

Week 2 is a wrap.  As my education in python, JavaScript, and software engineering practices continues, I find the challenge of keeping up with the class enjoyable and fulfilling.  From operators to iterables, I was able to delve into the elegance of different software design patterns. 

In terms of my class performance, there were both highlights and items with room for improvement.  After having a rough time with the quizzes for the previous week, I modified my study style and was able to enhance my performance to my expectations.  However upon being called on in class, I felt that I was not able to adequately respond to Dr. Downing’s questions during the code walkthroughs. Perhaps it was stage freight, but whatever the reason I can certainly do better.  In order to improve this I will aim to speak louder and to take a shot at the question even if I don’t know the answer as oppose to taking a few awkward quiet moments to respond. 

Project One came to a close and I thought it was an impactful project. I was able to not only refine my skills with unit testing, code coverage, and continuous integration servers but I also finished the project early. From learning useful mathematical principles to being able to pace myself for the first time in quite some time in regards to a CS project I enjoyed Collatz.
