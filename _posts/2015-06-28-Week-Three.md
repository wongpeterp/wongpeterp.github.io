title: Week Three
---



Week 3 entailed a plethora of learning experiences in regards to the python programming language, surviving in a formal workplace setting, and properly working with a teammate.  From an in depth study of iterators, iterables, and generators to listening to life advice from an engineer from Rackspace, class this week provided great insight into the world of software. 

In addition to the delivery of class content, I took our guest lecturer Everett Toews’, a software engineer at Rackspace, life advice to heart. As he emphasized the importance of tech, he regarded attitude as the overall most important attribute of a software developer.  With so much more to learn, I think that this single piece of advice is promising. As seasoned veterans are preaching that attitude and outlook can provide a pathway to learning more, it is comforting reassurance to someone who can feel the world of software can be quite overwhelming at times.

Furthermore outside the classroom but still inside the class, I furthered my appreciation for the power of communication. As I worked with a partner on project two, my partner and I were able to share ideas and skills in order to complete the project. I felt that the work we produced not only demonstrated a sharing of ideas but also a better product that would I have done the project alone. As we were able to pair effectively and continuously integrate through following the principles of pair programming, both my partner and I ‘s skills refined for the better. 

As a “tech tip of the week”, I highly encourage the use of the IDE Pycharm. It not only has all the basic functionality on your typical IDE, but it also presents a nice clean GUI for those new to python. I am using it to study for the first exam and I’ve found it to be a great local alternative to the traditional command line.  Until next week!
